# 08. Loading Data

Welcome to the **Loading Data** module! This module covers everything you need to know about fetching, loading, and managing data in SvelteKit applications using the realistic [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com).

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll discover:

1. **Load Functions Overview**
   - Universal (`+page.js`) vs Server-only (`+page.server.js`)
   - End-to-end type safety with `$types`
   - Layout load functions and data inheritance

2. **Advanced Load Patterns**
   - Parallel requests with `Promise.all`
   - **Data Streaming** for faster Time To First Byte (TTFB)
   - Custom invalidation with `depends()` and `invalidate()`

3. **Endpoints and API Routes**
   - Creating REST APIs with `+server.js`
   - Handling JSON and Form Data
   - Page/Endpoint coexistence in the same route

4. **Navigation Hooks and Loading UI**
   - Intercepting navigation with `beforeNavigate`
   - Global progress bars using the `navigating` store
   - View transitions and focus management

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- ✅ Choose correctly between universal and server-only load functions
- ✅ Implement type-safe data loading for all pages and layouts
- ✅ Speed up pages using parallel fetching and streaming
- ✅ Create custom API endpoints for external clients
- ✅ Provide a polished UX with real-time loading indicators

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- Knowledge of SvelteKit routing (`+page.svelte`, `+layout.svelte`)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript `fetch`, `async/await`, and `Promises`
- Familiarity with TypeScript (recommended for the type-safety sections)

## 💡 Why This Matters

Efficient data loading is critical for both performance and SEO. SvelteKit’s approach allows you to fetch data where it lives best—on the server for security or on the client for speed—while providing the best possible user experience with minimal boilerplate.

## 🎓 Recommended Learning Path

1. **01. Fundamentals**: Start with the overview of load functions.
2. **02. Optimization**: Learn to make your loads faster and more dynamic.
3. **03. API Design**: Explore how to build custom endpoints.
4. **04. Polish**: Add life to your app with lifecycle hooks and loading UI.
5. **📁 Advanced Topics**: Dive deep into dependencies, invalidation, error handling, and preloading in the [More about Load Func](./More%20about%20Load%20Func/00.%20discover.md) subfolder.
