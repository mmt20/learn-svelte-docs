# 06. Actions and Advanced Component Features

Welcome to the **Actions and Advanced Component Features** module! This module explores advanced Svelte features that give you fine-grained control over DOM elements, component bindings, and module-level logic.

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll discover:

1.  **Actions & Attachments**
    *   The `use:action` directive for elements
    *   **New:** The `@attach` tag for elements AND components
    *   Lifecycle, parameters, and 3rd party integrations

2.  **Advanced Bindings & Elements**
    *   `svelte:window`, `svelte:document`, `svelte:head`
    *   Handling `iframe`s and media elements
    *   Binding to element dimensions (`clientWidth`, etc.)

3.  **Module Context (`<script module>`)**
    *   Sharing state between instances
    *   Exporting functions from components
    *   Managing multiple component instances

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

-   ✅ Master the `use:` action directive for reusable DOM logic
-   ✅ Confidently use special elements like `<svelte:window>`
-   ✅ Handle complex media interactions with bindings
-   ✅ Understand when and how to use `<script module>` for instance management

| File | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | [Mastering Custom Actions](./01.%20Mastering%20Custom%20Actions.md) | `use:action`, `@attach` (Attachments), lifecycle, and 3rd party integrations |
| **02** | [Advanced Elements and Bindings](./02.%20Advanced%20Elements%20and%20Bindings.md) | `svelte:window`, media bindings, dimensions, and error boundaries |
| **03** | [The Script Module](./03.%20The%20Script%20Module.md) | module-level isolation, singletons, and cross-instance coordination |

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should be familiar with:

-   Basic Component Structure (Module 01/02)
-   Reactivity System (Module 03/04)

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

-   **Actions** are the "escape hatch" for direct DOM manipulation in a Svelte-way.
-   **Special Elements** let you interact with the browser environment declaratively.
-   **Module Context** solves architectural challenges when components need to coordinate with each other.
