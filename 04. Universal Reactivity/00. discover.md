# 04. Universal Reactivity

Welcome to the **Universal Reactivity** module! This module explores Svelte 5's revolutionary approach to reactivity that works everywhere—not just in components, but in regular JavaScript modules, utility functions, and shared state.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll discover:

1. **Introduction to Universal Reactivity**
   - What universal reactivity means in Svelte 5
   - Extracting logic using functions and classes
   - Sharing state between components
   - Different approaches: objects, classes, and proxies

2. **Reactive Modules and Shared State**
   - Creating reactive state outside components
   - Sharing logic vs sharing state
   - Global effects with `$effect.root()`
   - Persisting state to localStorage
   - Best practices and pitfalls

3. **Advanced Universal Reactivity Patterns**
   - `$effect.tracking()` for conditional tracking
   - `createSubscriber` for external reactivity
   - Reactive window properties (`scrollX`, `scrollY`, etc.)
   - Building reusable reactive classes
   - Real-world patterns and use cases

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- ✅ Understand the difference between sharing logic and sharing state
- ✅ Extract reusable reactive logic using functions and classes
- ✅ Share state across components using multiple approaches
- ✅ Create global effects for shared state
- ✅ Use advanced features like `$effect.tracking()` and `createSubscriber`
- ✅ Avoid common pitfalls when working with universal reactivity

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | [Introduction to Universal Reactivity](./01.%20Introduction%20to%20Universal%20Reactivity.md) | Understanding universal reactivity, extracting logic, and sharing state |
| **02** | [Reactive Modules and Shared State](./02.%20Reactive%20Modules%20and%20Shared%20State.md) | Global effects and localStorage persistence |

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should be familiar with:

- Svelte 5's `$state` and `$derived` runes (from Module 01)
- `$effect` for side effects
- Deep state reactivity (from Module 03)
- Component props and events (from Module 02)

## 💡 Why This Matters

Universal reactivity is one of Svelte 5's most powerful features because it:

- **Simplifies Architecture**: Share logic and state without complex patterns
- **Improves Code Organization**: Reactive logic can live where it makes sense
- **Enhances Reusability**: Create reactive utilities that work anywhere
- **Reduces Boilerplate**: Less ceremony than traditional stores or context
- **Better TypeScript Support**: Full type safety in reactive modules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Understanding the difference between **sharing logic** (each component gets its own state) and **sharing state** (all components reference the same state) is crucial for building scalable applications.

## 🎓 Recommended Learning Path

1. Start with **01. Introduction to Universal Reactivity** to understand the fundamentals
2. Move to **02. Reactive Modules and Shared State** for practical patterns
3. Finish with **03. Advanced Universal Reactivity Patterns** to master advanced features

Each file builds on the previous one, so following this order will give you the best learning experience.
