# 01. Rendering Concepts and Glossary

The core of SvelteKit provides a highly configurable rendering engine. This section describes the key terms and concepts used when discussing rendering in SvelteKit and modern web development.

---

## 🖥️ SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

**Server-side rendering (SSR)** is the generation of page contents on the server. The server processes the request, runs your Svelte components, and sends fully-rendered HTML to the browser.

### Why SSR Matters

-   **Performance**: Avoids extra round trips necessary in a SPA
-   **SEO**: Search engines can easily index your content
-   **Accessibility**: Works even if JavaScript fails or is disabled

> [!NOTE]
> In SvelteKit, pages are server-side rendered **by default**. You can disable SSR with the `ssr = false` page option.

---

## 🌐 CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

**Client-side rendering (CSR)** is the generation of page contents in the web browser using JavaScript. The server sends a minimal HTML shell, and JavaScript builds the page content dynamically.

> [!NOTE]
> In SvelteKit, CSR is used by default for navigation after the initial page load. You can turn off JavaScript entirely with the `csr = false` page option.

---

## 💧 Hydration

**Hydration** is the process of making server-rendered HTML interactive on the client.

### How It Works

1.  SvelteKit renders components on the server and stores their state
2.  The HTML and state are sent to the client
3.  Components initialize on the client with that data (no duplicate API calls needed)
4.  Svelte checks the DOM is in the expected state and attaches event listeners
5.  Components become fully interactive

> [!NOTE]
> Pages are hydrated by default in SvelteKit. Disable hydration with `csr = false`.

---

## 🔀 Hybrid App

SvelteKit uses a **hybrid rendering mode** by default:

1.  **Initial Request**: Server-side rendered HTML (SSR)
2.  **Subsequent Navigation**: Client-side rendering (CSR) for speed

This gives you the best of both worlds: fast initial loads with SEO benefits, plus snappy client-side navigation.

## 📦 Prerendering

**Prerendering** means computing page contents **at build time** and saving the HTML for display.

### Benefits

-   Same advantages as SSR (performance, SEO)
-   No runtime server computation per visitor
-   Scales nearly for free

### Limitations

-   Build process is more expensive
-   Content updates require a new deployment
-   Page must return the same content for all users (no personalization via SSR)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A page is prerenderable if any two users hitting it directly would get the same content, and the page has no form actions.

```javascript
// +page.js
export const prerender = true;
```

---

## 🏗️ SSG (Static Site Generation)

**Static Site Generation (SSG)** refers to a site where **every page** is prerendered at build time.

### Benefits

-   No servers needed for SSR
-   Serve from CDNs for excellent "time to first byte"
-   Often called **JAMstack** architecture

```javascript
// svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';

export default {
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter()
  }
};
```

---

## 🔄 ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

**Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** generates static pages **on demand** as visitors request them, without requiring a full redeploy.

### When to Use

-   Large sites with thousands of pages
-   Content that changes periodically but not in real-time
-   Reduces build times compared to full SSG

> [!NOTE]
> You can implement ISR with `adapter-vercel` in SvelteKit.

---

## 📄 SPA (Single-Page App)

A **single-page app (SPA)** serves a single, mostly empty HTML shell on every request. All rendering happens on the client via JavaScript.

### SPA Characteristics

-   Initial request returns minimal HTML
-   All navigation is client-side
-   Requires JavaScript to render any content

> [!CAUTION]
> SPA mode has significant **performance and SEO drawbacks**:
> - Two network round trips before rendering can begin
> - Content invisible to search engine crawlers that don't execute JS
>
> Use SPA mode only in limited circumstances (e.g., wrapped in a mobile app shell).

```javascript
// svelte.config.js - SPA mode with adapter-static
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';

export default {
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter({
      fallback: 'index.html' // SPA fallback
    })
  }
};
```

## 📚 MPA (Multi-Page App)

**Multi-page apps (MPA)** render each page view entirely on the server. This is the traditional model for server-side applications (PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc.).

-   Every navigation causes a full page reload
-   No client-side routing
-   Simple and robust, but can feel slower than hybrid apps

---

## 📱 PWA (Progressive Web App)

A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** is built using web technologies but functions like a mobile or desktop app.

### Key Features

-   **Installable**: Add to home screen, launcher, or start menu
-   **Offline capable**: Uses service workers for caching
-   **App-like experience**: Fast, responsive, immersive

> [!TIP]
> SvelteKit supports service workers for building offline-capable PWAs.

---

## 🧭 Client-Side Routing

By default, SvelteKit **intercepts navigation** (link clicks, browser back/forward) and handles it on the client instead of making full server requests.

### How It Works

1.  User clicks a link
2.  SvelteKit intercepts the navigation
3.  The new page component is rendered on the client
4.  API calls are made as needed for data
5.  URL updates without a full page reload

> [!TIP]
> Skip client-side routing for specific links with the `data-sveltekit-reload` attribute.

---

## ⚡ Edge Rendering

**Edge rendering** runs your application on a **content delivery network (CDN)** close to the user.

### Benefits

-   Shorter network distance = lower latency
-   Improved Time to First Byte (TTFB)
-   Global distribution of compute

Many SvelteKit adapters support edge deployment (Vercel Edge, Cloudflare Workers, etc.).

## 📊 Summary Table

| Term | Description | SvelteKit Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SSR** | Render on server, send HTML | ✅ Enabled |
| **CSR** | Render on client with JS | ✅ Enabled (for navigation) |
| **Hydration** | Make SSR HTML interactive | ✅ Enabled |
| **Prerender** | Render at build time | ❌ Opt-in per page |
| **SSG** | Prerender entire site | ❌ Opt-in via adapter-static |
| **ISR** | On-demand static generation | ❌ Opt-in (adapter-vercel) |
| **SPA** | Client-only rendering | ❌ Opt-in (not recommended) |

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1.  **SvelteKit is hybrid by default**: SSR for the first load, CSR for subsequent navigation
2.  **Prerendering** is great for static content that doesn't change per-user
3.  **Avoid pure SPA mode** unless absolutely necessary (mobile app wrappers)
4.  **Hydration** connects server-rendered HTML to client-side interactivity
5.  **Edge rendering** can reduce latency for global audiences
