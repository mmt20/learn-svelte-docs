# 03. Deep State Reactivity

Welcome to the **Deep State Reactivity** module! This module explores the JavaScript internals and advanced reactivity patterns that power Svelte 5's signal-based system.

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll discover:

1. **JavaScript Proxies and Object Setters & Getters**
   - How JavaScript Proxies intercept object operations
   - The role of getters and setters in class-based reactivity
   - Why Svelte uses both mechanisms for fine-grained tracking

2. **Deep State Reactivity in Svelte**
   - What fine-grained reactivity means and why it's powerful
   - How to track nested objects and arrays automatically
   - Two-way binding with `$bindable()` for parent-child communication
   - Practical examples with real-world use cases

3. **Debugging in Svelte**
   - Using `$inspect` for reactive logging
   - Tracing reactivity origins with `$inspect.trace()`
   - Getting raw data with `$state.snapshot()`
   - Template breakpoints with `{@debug}`
   - Avoiding common pitfalls like infinite loops

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- ✅ Understand the JavaScript primitives (Proxies, getters/setters) behind Svelte's reactivity
- ✅ Master fine-grained reactivity patterns for optimal performance
- ✅ Create two-way bindable component props with `$bindable()`
- ✅ Debug reactive state changes effectively using Svelte 5's debugging tools
- ✅ Avoid common reactivity pitfalls and infinite loops

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should be familiar with:

- Svelte 5's `$state` rune (from Module 01)
- Basic `$effect` usage
- Component props with `$props()`

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

Understanding deep reactivity isn't just academic—it directly impacts:

- **Performance**: Knowing what triggers updates helps you write more efficient code
- **Debugging**: Understanding the reactivity model makes bugs easier to trace
- **Architecture**: You'll make better decisions about component design and state management

> [!TIP]
> This module is more advanced than the previous ones. Take your time with the examples, and use your browser console to experiment!

## 🎓 Recommended Learning Path

1. Start with **01. Javascript Proxies and Object Setters & Getters** to understand the foundation
2. Move to **02. Deep State Reactivity in Svelte** for practical patterns
3. Finish with **03. Debugging in Svelte** to master the debugging tools

Each file builds on the previous one, so following this order will give you the best learning experience.
