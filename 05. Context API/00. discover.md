# 05. Context API

Welcome to the **Context API** module! This module bridges the gap between scoped component logic and shared state management, demonstrating how to pass data deeply through your component tree without prop drilling.

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll discover:

1.  **Context API Fundamentals**
    *   Set and get context mechanisms
    *   Scoped state vs. global state
    *   Handling missing context with fallbacks
    *   Creating type-safe context wrappers

2.  **Context Lifecycle and Reactivity**
    *   Initialization timing and constraints
    *   Reactivity patterns with `$state` in context
    *   Performance optimization and avoid unnecessary renders

3.  **Context vs. Universal Reactivity**
    *   Scoping: Global modules vs. local context
    *   SSR Safety and request-specific state
    *   Choosing the right state distribution pattern

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

-   ✅ Understand when to use Context over props or global state modules
-   ✅ Master Svelte 5's `$state` behavior within context
-   ✅ Build safe, encapsulated context functions using Symbols
-   ✅ Distinguish between logic sharing and state sharing in complex trees
-   ✅ Architect SSR-safe applications by leveraging context scoping

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should be familiar with:

-   Svelte 5's `$state` and `$effect` runes (Module 01)
-   Component props and children snippets (Module 02)
-   Universal reactivity basics (Module 04)

## 💡 Why This Matters

The Context API is crucial for:

-   **Library Authors**: Building compound components (like `<Map><Marker /></Map>`) that need to communicate implicitly.
-   **Clean Architecture**: Avoiding "prop drilling" where data is passed through layers of components that don't need it.
-   **Scoped State**: Creating sub-trees of state that are independent of other parts of the app (e.g., multiple independent map instances on one page).

## 🎓 Recommended Learning Path

1.  Start with **01. Introduction to the Context API** to master the core mechanism.
2.  Move to **02. Context Lifecycle and Reactivity** to understand timing and best practices.
3.  Finish with **03. Context vs Universal Reactivity** to learn architectural decision making.
